The model shows the options available at each step in the UI.
Each step has a pointer to the next step (Either "-" or "->")

	a) The "-" pointer shows the next step which either has another pointer or is a final step.
	b) The "->" pointer indicates that the next step is part of a main structure. 
	c) The Main structures are the LOGIN, MAIN OBJECTS and OBJECT OVERVIEWS.
